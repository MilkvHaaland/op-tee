# image config description
#   name:
#     file name of image in ext4,for example tee.bin
#   device:
#     device which use to store image
#   partition:
#     partition which use to store image,current partions used(number 1~6):
#       1: table
#       2: boot,include kernel image and dtb
#       3: tf,trust firmware
#       4: tee
#       5: stash
#       6: sbmeta
#       7: root,rootfs
#     if new paritions need to contact administrators to add new partitions
#   type:
#     type of image, it should be one of belows
#       dtb
#       kernel_image
#       sbi
#       aon_fw
#       tf
#       tee
#       customer
#   digest_scheme:
#     type of digest schema,used to fetch hash of image file,image file path represnets in config
#     of "image_path", it should be one of belows. Now we only support sha256 for international 
#     digest scheme and SM3 for national digest scheme.
#       none

#       sm3
#   sign_scheme:
#     type of digest schema, it should be one of belows. Now we only support rsa2048 for international
#     digest scheme and SM2 for national signature scheme.
#       none

#   is_image_encrypted:
#     0:image is not encrypted 1:image is encrypted
#   medium_type:
#     medinum type to store image, it should be one of belows
#       emmc
#       sd
#       tfcard
#       nandflash
#   relocated_addr:
#     image content will be loaded to relocated_addr when
#     image has been readed from storage by uboot
#   image_path:
#     local image file storage path,which default to like ./tee/tee.bin,use field algorithm of "digest_scheme"
#     to calculate digest of the image file
