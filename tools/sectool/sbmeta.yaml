# image config description
# [Mandatory]
#   name:
#     file name of image in ext4,for example tee.bin
#   device:
#     device which use to store image
#   partition:
#     partition which use to store image,current partions used(number 1~6):
#       1: table
#       2: boot,include kerne image and dtb
#       3: tee,include trust_firmware.bin and tee.bin
#       4: stash
#       5: sbmeta
#       6: root,rootfs
#     if new paritions need to contact administrators to add new partitions
#   type:
#     type of image, it should be one of belows
#       dtb
#       kernel_image
#       sbi
#       aon_fw
#       tf
#       tee
#       customer
#   algorithm:
#     algorithm for image signing, it should be one of belows
#       sm: national alogoritm, including sm2 and sm3
#       ia: international algorithm, including sha256 and rsa2048
#   is_image_encrypted:
#       0:image is not encrypted
#       1:image is encrypted
#   medium_type:
#     medinum type to store image, it should be one of belows
#       emmc
#       sd
#       tfcard
#       nandflash
# [Optional]
#   relocated_addr:
#     image content will be loaded to relocated_addr when
#     image has been readed from storage by uboot
#   image_path:
#     local image file storage path,which default to like ./tee/tee.bin,use field
#     algorithm of "digest_scheme" to calculate digest of the image file
#   checksum_scheme:
#     algorithm for calcute image file's digest. It should be one of belows
#       none
#       sha1
#       md5
#       sha224
#       sha256
#       sha384
#       sha512
#       sm3
#   version:
#     if image_path points to a valid image without secure header, sbmeta.py script
#     will sign the image by specified algorithm and version.
#     format: "x.y", where 0 <= x, y <= 255. "1.0" by default.
